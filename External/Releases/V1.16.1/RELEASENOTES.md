# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.16.1

## V1.16.1

### About

This is the 32nd release of my Khan Academy archive. I haven't created an update to this repository in a month, and I am currently trying to make monthly dual releases, starting with this release for December 2020 (All December 2020 data, published January 1st 2021)

This is what I did for this update:

<!--

> * Added data for December 2020

> * Added a project language file

> * Added release notes for the 30th version of this project.

!-->

> * Deleted 93 `IGNORE.md` files

<!-- > * Added data for December 1st 2020 (uncomment this if the update takes longer than 1 day) !-->

> * No other changes in this release

I finally released this update.
