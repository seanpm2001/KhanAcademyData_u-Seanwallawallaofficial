# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.15.1

## V1.15.1

### About

This is the 30th release of my Khan Academy archive. I haven't created an update to this repository in a long time. I will now try to make monthly dual releases, starting with this release for November 2020 (All November 2020 data, published December 1st 2020)

This is what I did for this update:

> * Deleted hundreds of `IGNORE.md` files

<!-- > * Added data for December 1st 2020 (uncomment this if the update takes longer than 1 day) !-->

> * No other changes in this release

I finally released this update.
