# Seans KA Archive - Version 1.15.0

## V1.15.0

### About

This is the 29th release of my Khan Academy archive. I haven't created an update to this repository in a long time. I will now try to make monthly dual releases, starting with this release for November 2020 (All November 2020 data, published December 1st 2020)

This is what I did for this update:

> * Added images and zip files from September 1st 2020 to November 30th 2020

> * Added several new pieces of documentation

> * Prepared a directory structure for all of 2021

> * No other changes in this release

I finally released this update.
