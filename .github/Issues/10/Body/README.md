### [Small feature request] Acronym file

A helpful piece of documentation for this project would be an Acronym file. It would ensure that everyone knows what the acronyms used on this project stand for. This is also something that is very easy to implement. I just didn't feel like adding it in today.

Here are some acronyms to start the list off:

> * KA
> * JS
> * PNG
> * SQL
> * HTML
> * CSS
> * JPG
> * MP4
> * WP3
> * WLMP
> * WMV
