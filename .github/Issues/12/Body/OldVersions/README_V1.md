### Find/recreate data for August 5th 2018

I searched for the images, videos, and project files for August 5th 2018 using all my methods on my current drive, but I couldn't find it. I am hoping it is one of the Khan Academy archives on an external drive. If not, it is possible to recreate it.

Once I get around to plugging that hard drive in and searching for Khan Academy pictures, I will try to remember to check for it.
