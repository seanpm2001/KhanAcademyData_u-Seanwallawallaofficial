### Original directory system

I have been uploading files to a formatted directory structure. This is the better approach, but I would like to also include the original directories from within a separate directory. I currently don't know what to name it, or how to structure it. The major current issue is the 1000 item per directory limit (FAT32 * 10)

The download archives must be separate from the singular daily Khan Academy archives. Maybe a part system? (part 1 > 1-900 | Part 2 > 901-1800 | Part 3 > 1801-2700 | etc...)
