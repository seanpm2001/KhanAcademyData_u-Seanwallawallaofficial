# Photography process

This document explains my process on getting the pictures for daily Khan Academy session, as of November 25th 2020.

## Laptop

**This process has been in place since the start and is still in use.**

After I catch up to the desktop screenshot part of my journaling, I take a desktop screenshot. After this, I have a 50-60 second timespan to get everything prepared or doing any other tasks before jumping on Khan Academy at the exact minute after getting a desktop screenshot.

I only watch 1 video a day, then I read all the articles preceeding and succeeding the video. Then, at the exact minute afterwards (sometimes I wait up to 58 seconds) I go to my profile page and take a screenshot. <!-- This is newish (1 video a day and article processs) starting in 2018 !-->

I typically only get 1 screenshot, unless more are needed. The screenshots for the laptop version are in PNG format.

## Mobile

**This is the newer process from late 2020 that is still in use. Separate pictures for mobile started in late 2020.**

Later on when I get my phone, I start my overnight journaling notes, then I get cellular Khan Academy screenshots via [Firefox for Android](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/) .if I don't get these pictures after the notes, I had likely forgotten, and will get them after my Tiny Tower session.

On mobile, I get coverage of all the parts of my profile, including:

> 1. The main profile

> 2. The learning/progress history section

> 3. The courses section

> 4. The teachers section

I later on started getting these pictures vertically, to act different from the laptop version. I typically get between 8-12 screenshots (max: 21) The screenshots for the mobile version are in JPG format.
