Installing KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial
---

SeansLifeArchive/Images/KhanAcademyData-u-Seanwallawallaofficial currently doesn't require installation, it is just a collection of images, video, and data. It is part of the Seanpm2001 Life Archive project, and for proper "installation" the repository should be placed under /SeansLifeArchive/<yourInstalledVersion>/Extras/KhanAcademy/

If you want to load the first project language file, you will need to have a compatible JavaScript framework installed (version 1.8 or higher)
For Windows users, INI files are included in many directories that were created pre-July 9th 2020. These INI files will provide a folder icon on Windows XP to Windows 10 that makes navigation a lot easier. I am working on a similar method for Linux, MacOS, and BSD.

If you want to view the image files, the majority of files are in PNG and JPG formats. Make sure your computer can handle images of 1920x200000/2560x1440/2560x1080/1920x1080 resolution well, and that your computer can handle PNG and JPG files.

Some image files are in other formats, such as SVG, and GIF. You will need support for viewing these files to view these files.

Some included files are in Markdown format (*.md) for best viewing, you should use a markdown viewer/markdown editor.

Some included files are in PDF format. They should be opened with a document viewer capable of handling PDF documents.
