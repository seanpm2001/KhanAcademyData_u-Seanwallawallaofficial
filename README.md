as North Korean has not been translated yet [Read about it here](/OldVersions/Korean(North)/README.md))

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SeansLifeArchive_Images_AndrOpen-Office/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate (pretty ironic for an anti-Google campaign) I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 9th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial
All of my Khan Academy data from my main account and my school account. The school account no longer exists. Link to my profile: https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/seanwallawallaofficial/

## About

See above

***

## Current issues

These issues are currently needing to be fixed:

1. [#1 Root folder is missing](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial/issues/1)

2. No other issues at the moment

***

## Major issues

On January 4th 2021, Khan Academy unexpectedly removed the consecutive day count tracker. This feature was not just an incentive, it was very helpful for tracking the days you are on and the days you aren't. All badges related to consecutive days were retired as well. This should have never been done in the first place, but even so, there should have been at least a weeks notice for the feature.

This unexpected removal left a massive negative stain on me mentally for the day, and now I am trying to decide whether I should keep using Khan Academy. What if they remove badges next? Energy points? Any kind of customization? Who knows? When you unexpectedly do something like this without giving a reason, it becomes hard to trust that everything won't get removed. Slowly, everything that makes Khan Academy unique is being removed. If they continue to do this, they are really going to lose users. I am so disappointed in this decision.

I still am locked on to Khan Academy until December 31st 2021, but now I have to decide if I am going to keep using Khan Academy after this point. The consecutive day count meter was one of my proudest achievements on the site. 1315 consecutive days are now gone, just like that, with no reason at all.

As of January 5th 2021, I am undecided.

## File naming history

This is the history of the file naming process for this project:

2017-2018: original screenshot labeled "screenshot.png" 6 other image files for different parts of the screen

2019-late 2020: screenshot labeled "KhanAcademy_Day`x`"

late 2020-present: screenshot labeled "KhanAcademy_Day`x`_Month`xx`2020_1080p, mobile screenshots unchanged

I thought this would be more interesting. Maybe I am missing some info

***

## About the tree INI

In the early days of the Khan Academy image structure, separate folders were given a custom icon in Windows 10, resembling a tree. Windows users (Windows 3.1 and up) can see an icon for a tree (meant to resemble the Khan Academy logo) on several Khan Academy image folders due to a `desktop.ini` file placed in their folders. This was not maintained, and stopped after a while.

***

## Episode series

I started a Khan Academy statistic series on YouTube for my early Khan Academy history from 2017 to late 2018, but then I stopped.

The video project files and videos themselves are still being uploaded, I have just taken a long hiatus.

***

## Programs used

I used several programs to create images and videos of Khan Academy progress. The programs include:

* Snipping tool (for images)

* Snip & sketch (for images)

* MS-PAINT 10.0 (for images, up to ~2019)

* Linux screenshot (for images, as of July 9th 2020)

* Windows Live Movie Maker 2012 (for videos, up to ~2019)

* Photo story 3 (for videos, up to ~2018)

* Firefox (for capture, from 2018 to present)

* Chrome (for capture, up to ~2018)

* Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 (for editing, 2017 to 2018)

* Adobe Photoshop CS6 (for editing, 2017 to 2018)

I used the following operating systems:

* Windows 10 (start to July 9th 2020) - NT-based

* Ubuntu 20.04 "Focal Fossa" (July 9th 2020 to present) - Linux-based

***

## Devices used

I used 3 different laptops for this project, all of them were Dell laptops (the latest being an XPS 13)

Laptop 1: Dell ??? (2017 to late 2018, then again in late 2018 to early 2018)

Laptop 2: Dell ??? (early 2019 to July 9th 2020)

Laptop 3: Dell XPS 13 9600 (JUly 9th 2020 to present)

***

## Documentation

Like most of my older projects, unfortunately I didn't start documentation immediately. This one however a very long time before documentation started, over 6 months.

[This file](PHOTOGRAPHY_PROCESS.md) goes into detail on my progress on Khan Academy documentation.

***

> Electrical engineering

> Computer programming

> Computer science

> Pixar in a Box

> Pre-Algebra

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](/DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
