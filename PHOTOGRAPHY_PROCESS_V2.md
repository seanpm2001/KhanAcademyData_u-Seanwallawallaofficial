# Photography

## Laptop

**This process has been in place since the start and is still in use.**

After I catch up to the desktop screenshot part of my journaling, I take a desktop screenshot. After this, I have a 50-60 second timespan to get everything prepared or doing any other tasks before jumping on Khan Academy at the exact minute after getting a desktop screenshot.

I only watch 1 video a day, then I read all the articles preceeding and succeeding the video. Then, at the exact minute afterwards (sometimes I wait up to 58 seconds) I go to my profile page and take a screenshot. <!-- This is newish (1 video a day and article processs) starting in 2018 !-->

I typically only get 1 screenshot, unless more are needed. The screenshots for the laptop version are in PNG format.

If I don't have an Internet connection, I typically wait until later, then continue the process by starting Khan Academy. When I don't have Internet, there can be a 30 minute-480 minute (8 hour) difference between the desktop screenshot and the KHan Academy session.

When I first started getting Khan Academy screenshots, I also took the time to run the images through Adobe Photoshop CC 2015/CS6 and make some edits, making separate image files that blurred out everything that wasn't of focus. There were usually 6 different screenshots back then. Later on, I couldn't use Photoshhop anymore, and I continued the process with MS-PAINT. This died off in 2019.

Before 2019, I also supplemented the images with a daily slideshow compilation that I would upload to my second YouTube channel as well. The videos were orginally made in Windows XP: Photo Story 3, before I made an upgrade to Windows Live Movie Maker 2012. As of mid-2019, I no longer do this. I can always start doing this again, but I will have to use different video editing software, as I no longer use Windows 10 as of July 10th 2020.

## Mobile

**This is the newer process from late 2020 that is still in use. Separate pictures for mobile started in late 2020.**

Later on when I get my phone, I start my overnight journaling notes, then I get cellular Khan Academy screenshots via [Firefox for Android](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/mobile/) .if I don't get these pictures after the notes, I had likely forgotten, and will get them after my Tiny Tower session.

On mobile, I get coverage of all the parts of my profile, including:

> 1. The main profile

> 2. The learning/progress history section

> 3. The courses section

> 4. The teachers section

I later on started getting these pictures vertically, to act different from the laptop version. I typically get between 8-12 screenshots (max: 21) The screenshots for the mobile version are in JPG format.
