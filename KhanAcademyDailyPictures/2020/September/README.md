# My September 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of September 2020.

September 2020 is my 41st consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued to work on World History for the entire month, making it through the current final chapter of the World History unit (20th century) for the rest of the month, from September 1st 2020 to September 30th 2020, with only 1 video left (for October 1st 2020)

It spans from day 1190 to day 1220. 6 significant consecutive day milestones was reached this month. They include:

1. Day 1200 - (12x100)

2. Day 1211 - (counting down, 12, 11)

3. Day 1212 - (double 12)

4. Day 1213 - (counting up, 12, 13)

5. Day 1215 - (counting up by 3s, 12, 15)

6. Day 1220 - (1, 22, 0)

7. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 3 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. 3 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. No other notes for this month
