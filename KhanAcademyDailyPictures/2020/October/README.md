# My October 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of October 2020.

October 2020 is my 42nd consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I finished the world history unit (October 1st 2020) and started the World History Origins unit (October 2nd 2020) which I worked on for the rest of the month.

It spans from day 1221 to day 1250. 4 significant consecutive day milestones was reached this month. They include:

1. Day 1222 - (3/4 2s)

2. Day 1224 - (counting by 12s to 24)

3. Day 1225 - (1 quarter between 1200 and 1300)

4. Day 1250 - (Halfway between 1200 and 1300)

5. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 4 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. 4 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. No other notes for this month
