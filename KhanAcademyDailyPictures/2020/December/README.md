# My December 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of December 2020.

December 2020 is my 44th onsecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I finalized the the World History Origins unit (Started: October 2nd 2020) which I worked on finishing up to December 5th 2020. I intend on starting the electrical engineering unit next, so I can learn the core concepts of electricity, along with intermediate knowledge on the workings of electricity.

It spans from day 1282 to day 1313. 2 significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month. They include:

1. Day 1300 - 13*100

2. Day 1313 - 2 13s, also final day of year

3. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 6 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. 5 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. As of October 21st 2020, a new cellular image format is being used, where the image is vertical, instead of horizontal. This is done to more easily cover content, and make a solid difference between desktop and cellular images.

4. On November 12th 2020, I got a new phone (Switched from: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 256 GB) starting the next day, I began getting Khan Academy cellular screenshots on this device.

5. No other notes for this month
