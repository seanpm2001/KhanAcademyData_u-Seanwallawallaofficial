# My November 2020 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of November 2020.

November 2020 is my 43rd consecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued the the World History Origins unit (Started: October 2nd 2020) which I worked on for the rest of the month, getting up to Chapter 7.1 (As of November 23rd 2020)

It spans from day 1252 to day 1281. 2 significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month. They include:

1. Day 1275 - (3/4 between 1200 and 1300)

2. Day 1280 - (ref: 1280x720)

3. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 5 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. 5 months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. As of October 21st 2020, a new cellular image format is being used, where the image is vertical, instead of horizontal. This is done to more easily cover content, and make a solid difference between desktop and cellular images.

4. On November 12th 2020, I got a new phone (Switched from: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 256 GB) starting the next day, I began getting Khan Academy cellular screenshots on this device.

5. No other notes for this month
