# February 13th 2021 incident

Tonight at around 9:59 pm, I experienced a severe panic attack that lasted over an hour. It hindered all further production for the night, and broke my Khan Academy streak. As of such, the consecutive day count has been reset to 0 for the rest of the year. If I continue Khan Academy past 2021, I will try to build back up again.

No screenshots of Khan Academy progress were taken today.
