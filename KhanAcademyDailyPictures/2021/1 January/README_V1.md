# My January 2021 Khan Academy experience

This directory contains my Khan Academy pictures from all of January 2021.

January 2021 is my 45th onsecutive month on Khan Academy. This month, I continued the biology unit. Also this month, the consecutive day count meter was removed on January 4th 2021, which might make me stop using Khan Academy on December 31st 2021 (As I am in a self-made contract)

It spans from day 1314 to day 1343. 1 significant consecutive day milestone was reached this month. They include:

1. Day 1333 - 3 3s

2. No other significant consecutive day milestones were reached this month

## Some notes

1. I got daily Khan Academy mobile/cellular screenshots all month again, a significant improvement was standardized early 7 months ago:

2. Originally, I only required desktop screenshots, which are in a low 1366x738 resolution. ? months ago, I started to get additional separate mobile screenshots, whcih are in 2560x1440 resolution, almost double of what I had before. I also got a new laptop on July 9th 2020, and the quality increased for desktop screenshots from 1366x768 to 1920x1200 (16:10, 1080p/1200p)

3. As of October 21st 2020, a new cellular image format is being used, where the image is vertical, instead of horizontal. This is done to more easily cover content, and make a solid difference between desktop and cellular images.

4. On November 12th 2020, I got a new phone (Switched from: Samsung Galaxy S7 edge to Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 256 GB) starting the next day, I began getting Khan Academy cellular screenshots on this device.

5. On January 4th 2021, Khan Academy removed the consecutive day count milestone and all badges related to it. Due to constant crappy design changes, I have decided to stop using Khan Academy on December 31st 2021, as that is when my current self-made trial ends. This would also help me de-google, as Khan Academy uses YouTube, and then I can drop another instance of YouTube usage.

6. No other notes for this month
