# License info for KhanAcademyData u/seanwallawallaofficial

This project ([`seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial/)) contains 2 segments: Khan Academy sandbox source code, and documentation + images.

I am required legally to license the source code under the MIT license, due to how it was licensed on Khan Academy. I am aware of the problems with the MIT license, which is why I am trying my best to separate the 2 segments from each other.

This is the license hub for KhanAcademyData_u-Seanwallawallaofficial. It is not a license itself, but describes what other licenses are used for.

The following licenses are in use:
