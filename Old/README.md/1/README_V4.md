## Major issues

On January 4th 2021, Khan Academy unexpectedly removed the consecutive day count tracker. This feature was not just an incentive, it was very helpful for tracking the days you are on and the days you aren't. All badges related to consecutive days were retired as well. This should have never been done in the first place, but even so, there should have been at least a weeks notice for the feature.

This unexpected removal left a massive negative stain on me mentally for the day, and now I am trying to decide whether I should keep using Khan Academy. What if they remove badges next? Energy points? Any kind of customization? Who knows? When you unexpectedly do something like this without giving a reason, it becomes hard to trust that everything won't get removed. Slowly, everything that makes Khan Academy unique is being removed. If they continue to do this, they are really going to lose users. I am so disappointed in this decision.

I still am locked on to Khan Academy until December 31st 2021, but now I have to decide if I am going to keep using Khan Academy after this point. The consecutive day count meter was one of my proudest achievements on the site. 1315 consecutive days are now gone, just like that, with no reason at all.

As of January 5th 2021, I am undecided.
